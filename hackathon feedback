Tic Tac Toe game.
This is a fantastic project.
I love that you chose a game, and I love the implementation of your code.
You showed your capabilities with DOM manipulation, functions, array methods,loops & conditionals.
Even though the game is simple it is functional and has NO bugs which is great.
The styling is also very nice a clean.
Good DRY code.
Fantastic job on your first hackathon!!
